# Pinecil_LED_Ring_HighPower

Inspired by Herushan's original Pinecil LED ring (https://github.com/Herushan/Pinecil_LED_Ring).

This version is designed for three ~0.2W LEDs, resulting in almost 100 lumens of light output.

Features a dedicated LED driver module (to be installed inside the Pinecil case), the LED ring itself, as well as PWM dimming using a modified version of IronOS (https://github.com/BlockWorker/IronOS-LED).

Work in progress.
